# Hi, I'm Chantal 👋

During the day, I work as a Web Analyst at musicMagpie, operating between Leeds and Manchester in the UK. My responsibilities include analysing data and creating visual representations where I can extract key insights. At night, I'm a part-time Computer Science MSc student at the University of Liverpool. Somewhere in-between I love running, and this year I'm running a relay race from London to Paris 🥐

My enthusiasm for learning and constantly developing my knowledge drives me to build valuable projects and bring innovative technologies to my job.


## Things I'm working on/interested in right now:

🔭 Working on a group project with the university where we are developing a simple client/server network
<br>
🌱 Actively trying to expand my knowledge of Python, JavaScript, and PHP
<br>
🤖 Interested in web app pen-testing and also trying to learn more about robotics
